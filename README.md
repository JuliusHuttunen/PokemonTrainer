Noroff Full Stack Assignment 4 - Angular Pokemon Trainer app

This is our take on the main assignment of the Noroff's Angular module.

The main purpose of our app is to display the 151 original Pokemons.

The user can "catch" Pokemons from the catalogue and add them to their collection.

Caught Pokemons can be released to and be caught again in the catalogue.
